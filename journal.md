### 🗓️ July 27 - 12 hrs
- Researched components for wheelchair
- Looking for the cheapest price for all components (this actually took such a long time)
- Searching YT tutorials and looking at companies who've made electric wheelchairs for inspiration when designing my own parts for the electric wheelchair

---

### 🗓️ July 28 - 15 hrs
- More research done on components for wheelchair (yes more research there was a lot I didn't know like TVS diodes, schottky diodes, and when to use capacitors)
- Finalizing which electronics should be module and which should be embedded on the board
- Found all links to buy components I need for this project
- Took dimensions of wheelchair to brainstrom 3d printable ideas

---

### 🗓️ July 29 - 17 hrs
- Started PCB schematic
- Finsihed PCB schematic
- Iteration 1 of the schematic

### 🗓️ July 31 - 14 hrs
- Updated schematic and wiring connection pins, added mounting holes and mounting hole pads
- Deciding whether to use copper pours or thick wiring
- Designed and cadded all 3d printable parts based on my wheelchair
  - Armrest mount with magnets
  - Walker handle and locking mech (copied fromy my wheelchair)
  - Battery box to hold 24V battery
  - PCB walls. I am leaving the front and back open to cool it down faster
  - Control panel with all six buttons and joystick. Will add breadboard in
  - Wiring will go from the PCB through the armrest mount to the panel
- Created GitHub repo and submitted everything!
- Rough design work for cadding parts
